Air Passenger Demand Forecasting for Delta Airlines
This repository contains the implementation of a time-series forecasting model using SARIMAX to predict passenger demand for Delta Airlines. The project aims to optimize flight scheduling and resource allocation by leveraging advanced statistical modeling and data analysis techniques.

Features
SARIMAX Model: Incorporates seasonality and exogenous variables for accurate demand forecasting.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates model performance using RMSE and MAPE.
Visualizations: Includes trend analysis, seasonal decomposition, and forecast visualizations.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, NumPy, statsmodels, matplotlib, scikit-learn
